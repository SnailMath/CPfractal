A program for the fx-cp400 that draws the Barnsley fern. 

This requires hollyhock-2 (or hollyhock) for the classpad II.

This will work on the fx-cp400, fx-cp400+E, fx-cg500 and on Linux or WSL.

Only tested it under WSL, but it works.

Start the program, it will draw the fern consisting of 4000 points. The screen is updatet after every 100 points and Clear or EXE closes the program.

If you want, you can change the values to another fractal and recompile the code.
